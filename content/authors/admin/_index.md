I am a Senior Research Scientist at [ByteDance Seed](https://www.bytedance.com/), where I work on large-scale reinforcement learning training infrastructure for foundation models (LLMs and VLMs). My work focuses on machine learning systems and distributed systems for efficient and stable post-training.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and my B.Eng. in Computer Engineering from the University of Hong Kong.

Previously, I worked at [Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com/), [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/), [Meta](https://about.meta.com/), and [Google](https://about.google/).
